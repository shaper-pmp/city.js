        <h3>City.js</h3>

<p>Demo of a random, procedurally-generated cityscape (work-in-progress).</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<p><a href="http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/shaper-pmp/city.js/blob/master/index.html">Click here for the demo</a>, served straight out of the GitHub repo trunk.</p>

<h2>Latest changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Helicopter/searchlight (traces a predefined spline-curve path around the city to show off dynamic lighting - left arrow key pauses flight, right arrow key resumes).</li>
<li>Per-face textures, and a (crappy, placeholder) lighted windows texture</li>
<li>Buildings are now generated from 1-3 CubeGeometry "parts", for more varied designs (not just monolithic slabs - now we have <em>architecture</em>!).</li>
<li>Buildings' parts are now also off-centred within each block (by random values proportionate to the dimensions of the part), for more visually-interesting, asymmetrical buildings.</li>
<li>Rudimentary street-light geometry.</li>
<li>Mousewheel zoom, as well as the old click+drag rotation.</li>
</ul><h2>Known bugs</h2>

<ul>
<li>Textures are correctly calculated for the first part of each building, but don't appear to be recalculated for each subsequent part, leading to stretching/compressing instead of desired fixed-size tiling effect.</li>
<li>Graphical glitches when two or more building/road parts exactly share a vertical/horizontal plane.</li>
</ul><h2>Future plans</h2>

<ul>
<li>Improve procedurally generated random textures.</li>
<li>White lines on road.</li>
<li>Better streetlight models, and add downward-pointing SpotLights to each.</li>
<li>Cars (as agents) tracing their own randomly-selected paths through city... perhaps even with collision-avoidance for more realistic behaviour?</li>
<li>Some sort of "grand tour" mode, which moves the camera on a randomly-generated spline-curve pathway through the city, diving between buildings, rotating around a specific one, pulling out/up/back for a broader view, etc.</li>
</ul>
