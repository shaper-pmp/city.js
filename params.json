{"body":"### City.js\r\nDemo of a random, procedurally-generated cityscape (work-in-progress).\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\n[Click here for the demo](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/shaper-pmp/city.js/blob/master/index.html), served straight out of the GitHub repo trunk.\r\n\r\n## Latest changes\r\n\r\n* Buildings are now generated from 1-3 CubeGeometry \"parts\", for more varied designs (not just monolithic slabs - now we have *architecture*!).\r\n* Buildings' parts are now also off-centred within each block (by random values proportionate to the dimensions of the part), for more visually-interesting, asymmetrical buildings.\r\n* Rudimentary street-light geometry.\r\n* Mousewheel zoom, as well as the old click+drag rotation.\r\n* Very simple lighting (one DirectionalLight).\r\n\r\n## Future plans\r\n\r\n* Procedurally generated random textures.\r\n* White lines on road.\r\n* Better streetlight models, and add downward-pointing SpotLights to each.\r\n* Helicopters with spotlights tracing spline-curve pathways over city, to show off three.js's dynamic lighting.\r\n* Cars (as agents) tracing their own randomly-selected paths through city... perhaps even with collision-avoidance for more realistic behaviour?\r\n* Some sort of \"grand tour\" mode, which moves the camera on a randomly-generated spline-curve pathway through the city, diving between buildings, rotating around a specific one, pulling out/up/back for a broader view, etc.","name":"City.js","note":"Don't delete this file!
