{"google":"","body":"### City.js\r\nDemo of a random, procedurally-generated cityscape (work-in-progress).\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\n[Click here for the demo](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/shaper-pmp/city.js/blob/master/index.html), served straight out of the GitHub repo trunk.\r\n\r\n## Latest changes\r\n\r\n* Helicopter/searchlight (traces a predefined spline-curve path around the city to show off dynamic lighting - left arrow key pauses flight, right arrow key resumes).\r\n* Per-face textures, and a (crappy, placeholder) lighted windows texture\r\n* Buildings are now generated from 1-3 CubeGeometry \"parts\", for more varied designs (not just monolithic slabs - now we have *architecture*!).\r\n* Buildings' parts are now also off-centred within each block (by random values proportionate to the dimensions of the part), for more visually-interesting, asymmetrical buildings.\r\n* Rudimentary street-light geometry.\r\n* Mousewheel zoom, as well as the old click+drag rotation.\r\n\r\n## Known bugs\r\n\r\n* Textures are correctly calculated for the first part of each building, but don't appear to be recalculated for each subsequent part, leading to stretching/compressing instead of desired fixed-size tiling effect.\r\n* Graphical glitches when two or more building/road parts exactly share a vertical/horizontal plane.\r\n\r\n## Future plans\r\n\r\n* Improve procedurally generated random textures.\r\n* White lines on road.\r\n* Better streetlight models, and add downward-pointing SpotLights to each.\r\n* Cars (as agents) tracing their own randomly-selected paths through city... perhaps even with collision-avoidance for more realistic behaviour?\r\n* Some sort of \"grand tour\" mode, which moves the camera on a randomly-generated spline-curve pathway through the city, diving between buildings, rotating around a specific one, pulling out/up/back for a broader view, etc.","note":"Don't delete this file!
